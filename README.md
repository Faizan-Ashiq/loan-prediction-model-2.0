##  Project Objective

Loan approvals are critical decisions in the banking and fintech sectors. Manual processing:
- Is **time-consuming**
- Can be **biased**
- Is **hard to scale**

The objective is to:
- Automate loan approval prediction
- Reduce processing time
- Improve consistency and fairness in decision-making

## Results Summary
The notebooks compare seven ML models and track their performance.
Final evaluation is done in accuracy_run.ipynb with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

Example (sample values):

Random Forest: ~80‚Äì85% accuracy

Gradient Boosting: ~78‚Äì82% accuracy

Logistic Regression: ~77‚Äì80% accuracy

(Random Forest often emerges as the top performer in classification problems with mixed categorical and numerical features.)
